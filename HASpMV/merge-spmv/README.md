# Merge-based Parallel Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication

<h4>Abstract</h4>

We present a strictly balanced method for the parallel computation of sparse matrix-vector products (SpMV). Our algorithm operates directly upon the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) sparse matrix format without preprocessing, inspection, reformatting, or supplemental encoding. Regardless of nonzero structure, our equitable 2D merge-based decomposition tightly bounds the workload assigned to each processing element. Furthermore, our technique is suitable for recursively partitioning CSR datasets themselves into multi-scale, distributed, NUMA, and GPU environments that are constrained by fixed-size local memories.

We evaluate our method on both CPU and GPU microarchitectures across a very large corpus of diverse sparse matrix datasets. We show that traditional CsrMV methods are inconsistent performers, often subject to order-of-magnitude performance variation across similarly-sized datasets. In comparison, our method provides predictable performance that is substantially uncorrelated to the distribution of nonzeros among rows and broadly improves upon that of current CsrMV methods.

<h3>The Algorithm</h3>

The central idea is to frame the parallel CsrMV decomposition as a logical merger of the CSR row-offsets and CSR non-zero data, which is then split equitably among parallel processors/threads.  This effectively paritions the *aggregate* CSR dataset in a manner such that no single processing element can be overwhelmed by assignment to (a) arbitrarily-long rows or (b) an arbitrarily-large number of zero-length rows.

![Merge-based parallel decomposition](https://github.com/dumerrill/merge-spmv/raw/master/merge_decomposition.png)

More specifically, we are logically merging two sequences: (*A*) the CSR row-offsets, and (*B*) the natural numbers ℕ that index the CSR nonzero values.  Individual processing elements are assigned equal-sized shares of this logical merger, with each processing element performing a two-dimensional search to isolate the corresponding region within each list that would comprise its share.  The regions can then be treated as independent CsrMV subproblems and consumed directly from the CSR data structures using the sequential method.

In general, a merge computation can be viewed as a decision path of length |*A*|+|*B*| in which progressively larger elements are consumed from *A* and *B*.  Fig. 7 illustrates this as a two-dimensional grid in which the elements of *A* are arranged along the x-axis and the elements of *B* are arranged along the y-axis.  The decision path begins in the top-left corner and ends in the bottom-right. When traced sequentially, the merge path moves right when consuming the elements from *A* and down when consuming from *B*.  As a consequence, the path coordinates describe a complete schedule of element comparison and consumption across both input sequences.  Furthermore, each path coordinate can be linearly indexed by its grid diagonal, where diagonals are enumerated from top-left to bottom-right.  Per convention, the semantics of merge always prefer items from *A* over those from *B* when comparing same-valued items. This results in exactly one decision path.

![CsrMV partitioning using the 2D merge path](https://github.com/dumerrill/merge-spmv/raw/master/merge_spmv.png)

To parallelize across *p* threads, the grid is sliced diagonally into p swaths of equal width, and it is the job of each thread is to establish the route of the decision-path through its swath.  The fundamental insight is that any given path coordinate (*i*,*j*) can be found independently using a two-dimensional search procedure.  More specifically, the two elements *Ai* and *Bj* scheduled to be compared at diagonal *k* can be found via constrained binary search along that diagonal: find the first (*i*,*j*) where *Ai* is greater than all of the items consumed before *Bj*, given that *i*+*j*=*k*.  Each thread need only search the first diagonal in its swath; the remainder of its path segment can be trivially established via sequential comparisons seeded from that starting coordinate.

We can compute CsrMV using the merge-path decomposition by logically merging the row-offsets vector with the sequence of natural numbers ℕ used to index the values and column-indices vectors.  We emphasize that this merger is never physically realized, but rather serves to guide the equitable consumption of the CSR matrix.  By design, each contiguous vertical section of the decision path corresponds to a row of nonzeros in the CSR sparse matrix.  As threads follow the merge-path, they accumulate matrix-vector dot-products when moving downwards.  When moving rightwards, threads then flush these accumulated values to the corresponding row output in y and reset their accumulator. The partial sums from rows that span multiple threads can be aggregated in a subsequent reduce-value-by-key “fix-up” pass.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<h4>CPU-based CsrMV</h4>

 * Intel CPU with AVX or wider vector extensions Intel CPU (two sockets of Xeon CPU E5-2695 v2 @ 2.40GHz as tested)
 * Intel C++ compiler and Math Kernel Library, both of which are included with Intel Parallel Studio (v2016.0.109 as tested)

<h3>Datasets</h3>

Our test programs currently support input files encoded using the [matrix market format](http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html).  All matrix market datasets used in this evaluation are publicly available from the Florida Sparse Matrix Repository.  Datasets can be downloaded individually from the [UF website](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/).

Additionally, the merge-spmv project provides users with the script `get_uf_datasets.sh` that will download and unpack the entire corpus used in this evaluation.  For example:

```sh
[dumerrill@bistromath merge-spmv]$ ./get_uf_datasets.sh ufl_mtx

[dumerrill@bistromath merge-spmv]$ ls ufl_mtx/
08blocks.mtx                         extr1b_Zeros_11.mtx                 nemsemm1_lo.mtx
1138_bus.mtx                         extr1b_Zeros_12.mtx                 nemsemm1.mtx
12month1.mtx                         extr1b_Zeros_13.mtx                 nemsemm1_z0.mtx

extr1b_Zeros_09.mtx                  nemsemm1_c.mtx                      Zhao1.mtx
extr1b_Zeros_10.mtx                  nemsemm1_hi.mtx                     Zhao2.mtx
```

*Warning: at present time this corpus requires 243GB of free storage.*

<h3>Building and Evaluating</h3>

We use GNU make to build CPU and GPU test programs, for example:

```sh
[dumerrill@bistromath merge-spmv]$ make cpu_spmv
[dumerrill@bistromath merge-spmv]$ make gpu_spmv sm=350
```

The GPU compilation takes an optional `sm=<cuda-arch, e.g., 350>` parameter that specifies the compute capability to compile for.  (For best results, compile the program for the maximal capability supported by the desired device.)

You can use the `cpu_spmv` and `gpu_spmv` test programs to compare CsrMV performance between MKL, cuSPARSE, and our merge-based implemenations.  For full usage information, specify the `--help` commandline option.  For example, on the CPU:
